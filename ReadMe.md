## Landscape:

Beem It is a mobile [Digital Wallet](https://www.canstar.com.au/transaction-accounts/beem-it/) with lot more features than its competitors with split payments being the most popular one.

Osko is the closest domestic competetor with most of the features in common. However, its split payments, loyalty program and request money features may be of some interesting features to note.

In late 2021 EFTPOS, BPAY and NPPA had plans to amalgamate to work towards building next generation digital payments platform. The new platform is slated to use [Beem It's QR code system to replace POS systems](https://www.zdnet.com/article/accc-gives-green-light-to-eftpos-merger-with-bpay-and-nppa/). The new entity is called as Australian Payments Plus (AP+)

GPay and Apple Pay are the global bigtech competitors that offers similar features as Osko while using built-in NFC in their phones to store bank cards.

## Results

Although Beem It requires a separate app install unlike Osko which is integrated within the bank app, split payments and loyalty programs are of some interest to many loyal customers.

AP+ enables Beem It's features to get to the next level. AP+ has decided to use Beem It's QR code system to be used for payments processing nationally.

## Recommendations

Crypto currencies are widely accepted as financial assets and therefore, the next logical step for AP+ is to enable Beem It to evolve as a single digital wallet to link a consumers' bank and crypto addresses. This enables Beem It as an All-In-One wallet for consumers.

While industry standard QR code payment processing is a big blow to the BigTech's who control the built-in NFC chips, Crypto wallets would boost the usage of Beem It even further.
